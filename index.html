      Greetings to everyone, my name is Walukagga Derrick and my testimony today is, "God can lift you from a nobody to a 'SOMEBODY'"
    </p>
    <p class="story-paragraph">
      My name is Walukagga Derrick a pastor and founder of the “GOD CARES CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE “Over 21 years ago, I lost my parents to HIV when I was 9 years old, the virus left a lot of children homeless and orphaned at that time, I didn't have family and nowhere to go. I remember I used to sit at the corner of a block and wait for strangers just to ask them for coins so I could get what to eat. I slept in one of the nearby blocks that were being constructed and every early morning is waking up went to find food. That same year, there was a one-week prayer conference where everyone was welcome, I only went because I expected free food, I sat down in the front next to the preacher and when the event was closing, a preacher asked me what my name was and if I had come with parents, I told him I was by myself and I was too hungry.
    </p>
    <p class="story-paragraph">
      This kind man took me and bought me a meal, he took me in to meet his family and treated me like his own son, his name was pastor “ Kibalama Peterson “I did not find CHRIST but CHRIST found me. That day I accepted Christ as my savior and joined the kid's church choir. I joined school again after being out for a year, and years later I learned a lot and with time I continued to grow in faith, by the Love of God. I completed my high school, God called me and I started reaching out to schools and shared my story how Christ found me and saved me, I inspired lots of teenagers who got saved in the name of Jesus Christ. I joined African Christian College where I finished my education. God chose me and I was ordained youth pastor at church.
